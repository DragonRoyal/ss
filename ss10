During the age of exploration I wanted to explore the New World. The kings and queens paid the money for the ship so I sailed off in hopes of finding precious metals and gold. I also wanted to explore the new world. We wanted to bring all types of stuff like native food and fruits. We wanted to expand our reach to all places. We wanted all types of objects.
 The map helped me a lot to find the new world. It showed the quickest routes and the different areas of the new world. The map I used was an old map that dated back a long time. I also used another tool called a compass, it was used to help me find which way was north and go the right direction. I did not use a digital compass. I used a real standard one that was also used a long time ago.
An item I brought back from the new world was this gold coin. We had workers in the new world to mine us gold and make us valuable gold coins. As you can see the gold coin i made below has various symbols it is because the gold coins we got all had all types of symbols. The gold coins also had lots of dyes on them. We made a lot of money there and deployed our flag.
Going to the new world was very interesting. We expanded our land by a lot and got control of some slaves. We currently have some people deployed there to keep control. We went to all types of places in the new world like villages and new forests. There were a lot of native fruits that we have never known existed. Going to the new world was very hard at first, but eventually we got into the new world. It took us a lot of time to get there.
