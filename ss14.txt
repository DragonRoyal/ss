I was reading a book in the evening blue mist when out of nowhere a percruiller bird came into view. The bird was blue with a shade of red under the feathers and was roughly the size of a golf ball. The bird seemed to be injured as its wings were all fidgety and weak looking. I carefully picked up the bird trying to not startle it while relocating it inside of my bird house. I rushed to my lab picking up tweezers and numb medicine. I started by numbing the area where the wings were broken so as to not hurt the bird during the process. I then picked up a wooden slab and carved it to roughly be the size and shape of a wing. Then I stitched it to the bird's feather that way later when it reaches enough strength to fly it will be able to. I made sure to pick up some bird food I had laying around and a small glass and filled it with water. I brought them to the bird and made sure to turn off the shutters so it could sleep.g
