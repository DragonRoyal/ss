In my city there was only one thing I held dear, the basketball team. Hearing the sound of balls being bounced over hardwood, the sound of nets swishing their way through while the crowd screams. The adrenaline you feel. I knew I had to make the team. Everyday I would spend countless hours practicing everything trying to cement my chances of getting in, handles, shooting and rebounding all of it. At this point it was becoming an obsession to make the team. This would be everything for me. My body sent signs to step it down every day, aching and hurting but I just pushed on “only 3 more days to go”. When I came up the next day with a limb that could barely move I knew I overworked myself too much but if I just last 2 days I could make a team I've been dreaming years to make. My shots suffered, my dribbling suffered, I couldn't even move my legs properly. I decided to make tomorrow a rest day thinking I have tryouts the next day and everything should work out fine. The next day I woke up with a fever of 102. I was laying bedridden completing r? Overworking my body to make a team I'll forget in a few years. I decided to just stop this idea of causing pretty much permanent damage to my body just to get a shot of making this team. Although I never ended up making the team I realized you need to balance chasing your dreams and being human because sometimes we get so caught up in our pursuit to a dream we end up not looking into the millions of other things that might change us.
