It was a dark and misty night and it was 1AM. My heart was pounding. I was sure I had seen the doorknob turn. But I dismissed it as the wind but I was still cautious. Ten seconds later I felt like the doorknob turn again. This time I was very paranoid and on toe. Once again I dismissed it thinking it was a strange coincidence. This time though the door was pounding, someone was loudly pounding it. Within seconds the knobs were moving and the lights were flickering, objects like chairs kept on moving back and forth until the door finally opened. There in the darkness I saw… A minion! He was yellow and had blue jeans. I looked closer and saw 50 more.. I was quite confused and had no idea what to do. They seemed like they were waiting for a command. I decided to command them to say “hello” and I heard hundreds of ”hellos” within the thick crowd. I assumed they thought I was their new master, I tried telling them multiple times I’m not but they wouldn’t listen. I gave up and just told him to go to the back yard and once again I saw hundreds of “minions” just rushing to the back yard. I was going to do another command when I saw a blue light just coming from the sky with loud sounds. It was almost going to hit the house.
