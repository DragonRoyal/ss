Did you know 50% of people never face their fears? That sounds like a scary number. But I was determined to face my fears, skiing… that one word gave me shudders just thinking about it. In case you are wondering why I'm so scared of skiing it's because the last time I went to the ski resort was a year ago. But oh boy did that scar my feelings for skiing. I was excited at first and went to a skiing place. And I was about to start, everything was good until… the middle. I slipped and fell and got so hurt I NEVER EVER wanted to ski again. But guess what? I was back in the very place that wanted me DEAD.
 
I wanted to run away and not ski but too late. I was already in the ski resort. Mom called me up to go follow her, so I did. Suddenly it felt like I was going to vomit. I was going to ski on the highest mountain. My stomach made a backflip. I wanted to run away and never ski but it was too late. 

I started skiing and thought about all the bad stuff that could happen to me. I shuddered just thinking about it. As I was ¼ of the way down I started realizing this wasn't too bad. Nevertheless, I never knew what horrors were ahead. I stared in utter dismay. The mountain area up ahead looked very steep. For what seemed a millisecond my ski just went blazing fast. I was so swift. I was scared out of my mind.
