AI and robots have multiple benefits that often outweigh the drawbacks. This is because robots in today's workforce will quickly manufacture different products and streamline the process. Robots also don't make mistakes like we do for example for making medicines they already use robots to evenly distribute the vitamins in a pill to a safe dosage. If a human were to do it they could accidentally mess up and make it dangerous for consumption. “AI and robots contribute to safety in hazardous environments where human intervention may pose a risk”.

Another reason Ai and robots can help is for doing time consuming tasks like generating finance reports and budgets. Ai can also help with writing emails to people, a potential problem with this is AI and robots taking the jobs of humans in the workforce but really if almost all jobs became automated then humans would not need to work and would just get food and essential needs for free. The biggest problem is humans becoming too dependent on AI and robots causing them to not innovate at all and for humanity to become stagnant. That is a problem that needs to be addressed but at our current time has almost no solutions. 

This is why I believe AI and robots can help humanity advance further and just clear up labor and time extensive tasks, opening up time for us to create new innovations. Most of the drawbacks here are just speculations with little tangible value that can be fixed with proper guidelines but overall robots and ai can do tasks humans never thought before were possible.
