        The plan

 They decided that one of them would distract a guard while the other would take a keycard and act casually; they soon put their plan to the test. The day finally came and they did their plan but it didn't go as expected, first another officer was always surrounding the officer they were talking to and it was super hard  to steal the keycard. So they ditched that idea. Their other plan was to bribe the police and they  had a couple of hundred bucks.





                                           Jailbreak

The loud sounds of footprints were thundering it was very stormy 
Mat kept at shooting at the policies but it seemed it would never end until they found the wall they blasted it and ran as quick as they can to the camaro and drove to the gun shop they grabbed their basic shotgun and left to the donut shop mat stranded guard and jonn robbed it and then split the money between them  1 day they hopped to be as good as jeff the killer is in robbing and escaping. They only knew how to rob gas and donut shop.




                                              Expert robbers
When they came back from the crime base they saw a lot of pro robbers and they told them that they could rob the museum with them. It was like a dream come true so they said yes and met at the museum. Since they never robbed it before. The other people helped them. After all the tests they were ready! They broke in and stole a mummy. The pro people told them they didn't know how to do the hard puzzle but lucky for them  Mat and Jonn were very good at puzzles and quickly finished it. They went to the volcano base and took their cash. They were very happy they robbed the  museum.
