The war in video games

About 90% of people believe video games cause violence. That is shocking. Imagine your mom just reading a conspiracy article on the internet and bans all your video game access for no reason. And all this is caused by misinformation. This happens a lot and just results in parents pinning all their kid's problems on video games which is dangerous. The fact these parents can’t understand that outside factors like bullying can cause violence is threateningly bad. I believe all these conspiracy articles and websites should be shut down by someone as video games aren’t fully to blame for this problem. This will help reduce misinformation, allow parents to sit down and talk to their child about problems in life, and just help your parents understand the real effects of video games.                                                                                                           

First of all, I need to clarify video games do NOT cause school shootings. Video games are a relaxing way for people to connect. Many studies have shown that video does not cause violence. Such as the Oxford study which showed that video games do not provoke violence. There are even entire subreddits that video games should be banned like r/banvideogames how people could be so ignorant surprises me. Most people are just misinformed though. Most experts agree that video games improve cognitive skills and more. Video games also expose kids to technology more early in this technology-based world. With all these points one might wonder, how do people believe such myths. All misinformation. To sum it up, video games don't cause violence.
