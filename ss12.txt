Community service is an extremely important part of society. I believe it's important to go out and do volunteer work since it can help those around you in many positive ways. For example non profit organizations which rely on donations and other forms of help can greatly benefit from volunteering. You are taking your time to help them with tasks such as running errands for them. It also builds up confidence and more social skills which are really important to all of us as human beings.
Firstly, community service is important since organizations such as APA (Austin pets alive) really rely on people volunteering and taking care of the pets at the shelters and giving them food, water, and human interaction. Also doing this lets the organization not have to spend money on workers and instead use that money on other important things. This raises more awareness which ultimately results in more people adopting pets from them.
Secondly It helps build you up as a person. When you are volunteering you are building up your own character and morale. You will also develop many humane skills such as empathy and generosity that will be useful to you throughout your life. When you are volunteering you also get a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment that is immeasurable. You are finding a sense of who you are and what you want to be.
Lastly if you ever need help or assistance in life, the community will be there to help you. Just like how you were volunteering for people in assistance, the community will do the same for you.  
Overall volunteering makes the world a better place by constantly helping everyone. It builds  long lasting mutual trust and respect creating a healthy and thriving community.
